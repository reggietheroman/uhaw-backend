API for a simple protoype plant watering application.

This project tries to implement [Clean Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164) by [Bob Martin](http://www.cleancoder.com/products).

This is my first project implementing clean architecture and I would appreciate constructive criticism.
