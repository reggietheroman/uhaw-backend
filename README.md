# Uhaw Backend

API for a simple protoype plant watering application.

This project tries to implement [Clean Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164) by [Bob Martin](http://www.cleancoder.com/products).

This is my first project implementing clean architecture and I would appreciate constructive criticism.

### Setup
1. git clone project
2. `npm install`

### Running
1. `npm run startDev`

### Resources
1. This video by Bill Sourour of Dev Mastery [Using Clean Architecture in Node.js with MongoDB and Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnailTcJV_U).
2. The [github repo](https://github.com/dev-mastery/comments-api) of the above video.
3. Another [github repo](https://github.com/jbuget/nodejs-clean-architecture-app) showing clean architecture but using Hapi.js instead of Express.js.
4. The image in this [stacoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57247085/correct-management-of-repository-in-clean-architecture) question is good. It also answers the question of how to use the repository pattern in clean architecture.
